## Cookiecutter: AWS SAM DynamoDB Event Example

SAM app that reads and logs DynamoDB events

This is a [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template to create a Serverless Hello World App based on Serverless Application Model (SAM) and Python.

It is important to note that you should not try to `git clone` this project but use `AWS SAM CLI's` init command instead.

## Requirements

Install `AWS SAM CLI` by following their [installation instructions](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli/blob/develop/docs/installation.rst).

## Usage

Generate a new SAM based Serverless App: `sam init --location gh:aws-samples/cookiecutter-aws-sam-dynamodb-python`.

You'll be prompted a few questions to help this cookiecutter template to scaffold this project and after its completed you should see a new folder at your current path with the name of the project you gave as input.

**NOTE**: After you understand how cookiecutter works (cookiecutter.json, mainly), you can fork this repo and apply your own mechanisms to accelerate your development process and this can be followed for any programming language and OS.
